Title: Enhancing Performance with Web Workers: A Comparative Study

Target Audience: Software Developers/ Technical Managers who want to compare performance metrics of a web application with and without Web Workers to get a better perspective about how Web Workers can enhance the performance of an upcoming project.

Introduction Web Workers allow us to run JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main thread. This means we can perform complex tasks without freezing the user interface.

This post is going to compare the performance difference of a web application with and without Web Workers in terms of:

The most significant metrics in the case of Web Workers would be:
1. Scripting Time: Web Workers run scripts in the background, separate from the main execution thread of a web application. Therefore, the time spent in the scripting phase can be significantly reduced when using Web Workers, especially for resource-intensive tasks.
2. Time To Interactive (TTI): Web Workers can improve the time it takes for a page to become fully interactive by offloading heavy computations to a separate thread. This means the main thread can remain free to respond to user input, potentially reducing the TTI.
3. Heap Size: Web Workers have their own global scope, separate from the main thread. Therefore, they can help manage memory more efficiently and potentially reduce the heap size, especially for large applications or those that perform complex tasks.
4. Rendering Time: By offloading heavy computations to a separate thread, Web Workers can help ensure that the main thread remains free to render the UI. This can potentially reduce the time spent in the rendering phase.
