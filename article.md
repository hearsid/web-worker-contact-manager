Title: Enhancing Performance with Web Workers: A Comparative Study
Introduction
Briefly introduce the concept of web workers and their role in improving web application performance.
Mention the purpose of the article, which is to compare the performance of a web application with and without web workers.
What are Web Workers?
Explain what web workers are and how they work.
Discuss the benefits of using web workers, such as offloading heavy computations to a separate thread to prevent blocking the main thread.
Setting Up the Experiment
Describe the web application you'll be using for the comparison. It could be a contact manager application similar to the one used in your previous article.
Explain how you'll implement web workers in the application.
Performance Without Web Workers
Run the application without web workers and record the performance metrics.
Discuss the results and any performance issues encountered.
Implementing Web Workers
Describe the process of implementing web workers in the application.
Discuss any challenges encountered and how you overcame them.
Performance With Web Workers
Run the application with web workers and record the performance metrics.
Discuss the results and any improvements in performance.
Comparison and Analysis
Compare the performance metrics of the application with and without web workers.
Analyze the results and discuss whether using web workers improved the performance.
Conclusion
Summarize the findings of the experiment.
Discuss the potential benefits of using web workers in web applications, based on the results of the experiment.
